CocoaPods is a package management tool for iOS and macOS development. We use it to add the actual React Native framework code locally into your current project.
* We recommend installing CocoaPods using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):
  $ brew install cocoapods

## Install Package and In Project ( Hataraclub_app):
  ### 1. Install package
    yarn install / npm install 

  ### 2. If using macOS development then install the React Native [pod](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/integration-with-existing-apps.html#configuring-cocoapods-dependencies) (in directory Hataraclub_app/ios)
